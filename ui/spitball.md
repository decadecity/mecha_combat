# Spit balling

## Now

* Repair option only available if damage taken. 
* Repair can be by section (30%) or to all sections (10% to each).
* Get a different Mecha depending on sliders (outline and name).
* Can rename Mecha.

## Future

* Close combat, if range = 0 then enter close combat. Might have to adjust the movement screen, with player adding direction.
