# Mecha Combat
Combat between mecha.  Using a web app.  Very rough proof of concept.

Three different parts: `game-engine`, `messaging` & `ui`.  Would normally be three seperate projects but all here for ease of development.  These all have their own `package.json` so all work independently.

## Game Engine
State and maths.

## Messaging
Abstraction layer over the comms between the mechas.

## UI
The app that's delivered to the browser.
